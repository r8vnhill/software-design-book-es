% | The package starts from the basic facilities of the color package, and provides easy 
% | driver-independent access to several kinds of color tints, shades, tones, and mixes of arbitrary 
% | colors. 
% | It allows a user to select a document-wide target color model and offers complete tools for 
% | conversion between eight color models. 
% | Additionally, there is a command for alternating row colors plus repeated non-aligned material 
% | (like horizontal lines) in tables. Colors can be mixed like \color{red!30!green!40!blue}.

% | This package provides an environment for coloured and framed text boxes with a heading line. 
% | Optionally, such a box may be split in an upper and a lower part; thus the package may be used 
% | for the setting of LATEX examples where one part of the box displays the source code and the 
% | other part shows the output. 
% | Another common use case is the setting of theorems. 
% | The package supports saving and reuse of source code and text parts.
